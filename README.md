## Welcome :cow: :heart:

Hi, welcome to the statistical analysis part of our shiny app! Link to our app here: [Cow-bonds](https://cow-bonds.fun)


### Introduction

The goal of this repo is to give an overall idea of the Bayesian methodology based on the recent research model [BISoN](https://github.com/JHart96/bison_examples) and how to implement the analysis on our cows' behavioral dataset. We intend to answer questions such as: Do cows have their social preference? What factors affect their relationships? These are the research questions that have not been widely studied and we are able to answer them with the help of Bayesian analysis.

The sample size can affect the uncertainty of our estimates. For example, if there is only one observation between a pair of cows in our sample data, intuitively the uncertainty of edge weight between this dyad is larger than the case when the same count has been observed for a hundred of times. If the network estimates are unreliable, this could lead us to draw incorrect conclusions. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the uncertainty of the network edge weights. Bayesian analysis can inherently quantify the uncertainty by calculating posterior distribution for each estimates.

### Future work

The app is still in development and more customized features are coming soon!
